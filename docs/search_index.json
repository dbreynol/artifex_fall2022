The primary objective of this course/ club is to equip its members with the essential skills of a data scientist. The course delivery is a mix of lectures and project-based learning. The lectures will alternate between theory and tools. For the first half of the semester, the theory part of the course will be focused on linear regression and the tools part of the course will be related to R, R Studio, and Github. In the second half of the course, the theory will be focused on time series analysis and students will work in teams on a complex time series dataset hosted in Kaggle. Prerequisites and Preparations You should have some basic knowledge of R, and be familiar with the topics covered in the Introduction to R. Have a recent version of R and RStudio installed. Install and load the tidyverse package. References Boehmke, Bradley C.

As is almost always the case, this data needs some pre-processing before it is in shape for exploration and analysis. Copy and paste the code below to obtain this data frame in your environment. The processing steps we carry out below rely on the lubridate package, so start your script with library(lubridate). set.seed(1) customer = c(&quot;113 - Shaws&quot;, &quot;217 - Shaws&quot;, &quot;2114 - WalMart&quot;, &quot;99 - WalMart&quot;, &quot;23 - CVS&quot;, &quot;09 - CVS&quot;) # numbers dash name product = c(&quot;WX1X - 9 gal - Jelly&quot;, &quot;WX1P - 4 gal - Jelly&quot;, &quot;QP1X - 11 gal - Grape Juice&quot;, &quot;QP1 - 7 gal - Fruit Juice&quot;, &quot;TYL - 1 gal - Peanut Butter&quot;, &quot;LL - 2 gal - Jam&quot;) # letters size description business_unit = c(&quot;123 Retail&quot;, &quot;437 Consumer&quot;, &quot;990 International&quot;, &quot;222 Retail&quot;, &quot;49 Consumer&quot;, &quot;09 International&quot;) # number dash name df = data.frame(customer, product, business_unit, &quot;1-1-2022&quot; = rpois(6, 1100), &quot;2-1-2022&quot; = rpois(6, 1200), check.names = F) Table 1.1: A fake dataset on product shipments. customer product business_unit 1-1-2022 2-1-2022 113 - Shaws WX1X - 9 gal - Jelly 123 Retail 1079 1225 217 - Shaws WX1P - 4 gal - Jelly 437 Consumer 1144 1219 2114 - WalMart QP1X - 11 gal - Grape Juice 990 International 1142 1189 99 - WalMart QP1 - 7 gal - Fruit Juice 222 Retail 1113 1172 23 - CVS TYL - 1 gal - Peanut Butter 49 Consumer 1048 1178 09 - CVS LL - 2 gal - Jam 09 International 1116 1189 Our pre-processing of this particular dataset consists primarily of cleaning up the character variables and dealing with dates. 1.1 Cleaning up strings Some aspects of this dataset that are distracting for analysis include: The meaningless (to us) numbers that precede the customer name and business unit. The meaningless letters that precede the product description. The product variable includes the size which would ideally exist in its own column (i.e., we want a size column whose first entry is 9) Let’s work through each of these using the functions str_sub, str_locate, and str_split. Let’s first go over what these functions do and how they can be used for this task. str_sub(&quot;The big short&quot;, start = 5, end = 7) # big # the input can also be a vector x &lt;- c(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;) # character vector str_sub(x, 1, 3) # &quot;App&quot; &quot;Ban&quot; &quot;Pea&quot; str_locate(&quot;This&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) # gives the starting and ending position of the &#39;s&#39; in &#39;This&#39; The patterns that are located can be much more general than a literal letter. These patters are known as regular expressions. For example, suppose we would like to locate the part of the string that consists of the letter a followed by any number. The regular expression that represents any digit is \\d. str_locate(&quot;aardvark a3&quot;, &quot;a\\\\d&quot;) # 10 11 For more on matching regular expressions in R, see this document on the topic. How can these two functions (str_sub, str_locate) be used in conjunction to deal with the first issue identified above? Try this out using the first entry from customer. Next, let’s deal with the product variable. This variable contains two potentially useful pieces of information and one useless piece. They are separated by a dash. This presents a good use case for the str_split function. str_split(&quot;200:300&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, simplify = T) # 200 300 What should we split the product variable on? This will give us a matrix, with two useful columns. We want to grab these columns and include them in our data frame as size and product. Refresher on how to carry out these sorts of tasks - How R thinks about data. 1.2 Dealing with dates "],["setup.html", "Chapter 2 Setting up Bookdown 2.1 Get “bookdown-tutorial” going on your local computer 2.2 Create your “awesome-book” GitHub repo 2.3 Turn “bookdown-tutorial” into “awesome-book” 2.4 Publish “awesome-book” 2.5 Moving forward", " Chapter 2 Setting up Bookdown The bookdown package and book is definitely the best way to get started. However, in practice I always find myself copying an existing, working book and modifying it instead of starting from scratch. So this tutorial is going to have you do that as well, using this book as the one you copy from. [more setup here] You will have to name your book’s repository. To differentiate your book’s repo name from this “bookdown-tutorial” repo, here we’ll call your book “awesome-book” but you should consistently name it what you want to name it. 2.1 Get “bookdown-tutorial” going on your local computer Go to https://github.com/jules32/bookdown-tutorial Click the green “clone or download” button and DOWNLOAD ZIP. Locally on your computer, unzip the folder, save it in a reasonable place Rename 2 things from “bookdown-tutorial” to “awesome-book.” You can do this in the finder/windows explorer: the folder itself (that you just unzipped) the .Rproj file Double-click the .Rproj file to launch RStudio Install packages and restart install.packages(\"bookdown\") install.packages(\"usethis\") Use the menu item Session &gt; Restart R Click on the Build tab in the top right pane Click on Build Book! Nice job! Now let’s make it yours, and connect it to GitHub. 2.2 Create your “awesome-book” GitHub repo Go to your GitHub account: github.com/username Click on Repositories, and the green button “New” to create a new repo Name this new repo “awesome-book” DO NOT initialize this repo with a README Click the green “create repository” button — this will take you to your new repo Click the tiny “clone or download” button near the top and COPY URL 2.3 Turn “bookdown-tutorial” into “awesome-book” The following is from Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git With R Go back to RStudio, to your “awesome-book” project In the Console, type usethis::use_git() and say Yes to the two prompts. This will restart R and give you a new Git tab in the upper right pane. Now, click on the Terminal tab next to the Console tab. Type git remote add origin &lt;paste your copied awesome-book github url here&gt; Type git push --set-upstream origin master 2.4 Publish “awesome-book” Last steps! Go back to github.com/username/“awesome-book” and refresh — our files should be there! But we want it to be a book published as https://username.github.io/awesome-book. Click Settings Scroll down to GitHub Settings Change the Source pulldown from “None” to “master branch /docs folder” It should say “Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/awesome-book/” — click the link to see! Now, you’re set — you just need to write your book. 2.5 Moving forward As you write your .Rmd files, build the book and commit all files, including the docs/ folder, and your published book will be updated!
